MCPass_Mod is a module for the PHP-IRC bot available for download at http://www.phpbots.org/ that connects to the HTTPConsole plugin (available here: http://forums.bukkit.org/threads/web-dev-admin-httpconsole-0-2-1-issue-console-commands-over-http-740.12504/) running on a Minecraft Bukkit server. Mainly written as a simple learning project, this module is very simple and provides only basic functions. This module has the potential to allow an attacker to gain access to your server console. Therefore, it is advised to use your IRC network's services to provide protection in the form of nickname registration and access control lists.
